# Computer Vision RPS

## Milestone 1: Set up the environment

### Task 1
- In this project, I will use GitHub to track changes toyourcode and save them online in a GitHub repo.

## Milestone 2: Create the computer vision system

### Task 1
- Create an image project model with four different classes: Rock, Scissors, Paper, and Nothing
- Go to Teachable-Machine  to start creating the model. 
- Each class is trained with images of yourself showing each option to the camera. 
- The "Nothing" class represents the lack of option in the image. 
- Remember that the more images you train with, the more accurate the model will be

### Task 2
- Download the model
- Download the model from the "Tensorflow" tab in Teachable-Machine. 
- The model should be named keras_model.h5 and the text file containing the labels should be named labels.txt.
- The files you are downloading contain the structure and the parameters of a deep learning model. 
- They are not files that can be run, and they do not contain anything readable if I look inside. 
- Later, I will load them into your Python application in the next milestone.
- Make sure I push the model and labels to my GitHub repository after committing.

### Task 3
- Begin documenting the experience 
- Now that I have created your model and downloaded it, add documentation to your README file following this guide.
